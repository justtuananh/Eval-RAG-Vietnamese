The\ndirection could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When\na robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs\nthe robot, and it stops moving.\n\nAt any moment, you can set the initial direction of moving for some robot.\nYour target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots.\n\nReturn the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots. The test cases\nare generated such that all the robots can be repaired.\n\nNote that\n\n* All robots move at the same speed.\n* If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide.\n* If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other.\n* If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.\n* If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: As shown in the figure:\n- The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.\n- The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory.\n- The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move.\nThe limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots.\nThe limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: As shown in the figure:\n- The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction.

It will be repaired at the first factory.\nThe limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot.\nThe total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2.

Let the value of a component be the sum of all `nums[i]`\nfor which node `i` is in the component.\n\nReturn the maximum number of edges you can delete, such that every connected\ncomponent in the tree has the same value.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [6,2,2,2,6], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]] \nOutput: 2 \nExplanation: The above figure shows how we can delete the edges [0,1] and [3,4]. The created components are nodes [0], [1,2,3] and [4]. The sum of the values in each component equals 6. It can be proven that no better deletion exists, so the answer is 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2], edges = []\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no edges to be deleted.\n\nConstraints:\n\n* `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`\n* `nums.length == n`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`\n* `edges.length == n - 1`\n* `edges[i].length == 2`\n* `0 <= edges[i][0], edges[i][1] <= n - 1`\n* `edges` represents a valid tree.", "entry_point": "componentValue", "is_solved": true, "reflections": [], "implementations": ["from typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef componentValue(nums: List[int], edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n    def can_split(target):\n        visited = [False] * n\n        def dfs(node):\n            visited[node] = True\n            total = nums[node]\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    result = dfs(neighbor)\n                    if result == -1:\n                        return -1\n                    total += result\n            if total > target:\n                return -1\n            return total if total < target else 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                if dfs(i) != 0:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v in edges:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    total_sum = sum(nums)\n    for k in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if total_sum % k == 0:\n            if can_split(total_sum // k):\n                return k - 1\n    return 0"], "test_feedback": ["Tested passed:\nassert componentValue([6,2,2,2,6], [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]) == 2\nassert componentValue([2], []) == 0\n\nTests failed:"], "solution": "from typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef componentValue(nums: List[int], edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n    def can_split(target):\n        visited = [False] * n\n        def dfs(node):\n            visited[node] = True\n            total = nums[node]\n            for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    result = dfs(neighbor)\n                    if result == -1:\n                        return -1\n                    total += result\n            if total > target:\n                return -1\n            return total if total < target else 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                if dfs(i) != 0:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v in edges:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    total_sum = sum(nums)\n    for k in range(n, 0, -1):\n        if total_sum % k == 0:\n            if can_split(total_sum // k):\n                return k - 1\n    return 0", "is_bad": false}
