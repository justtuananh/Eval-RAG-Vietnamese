# Graduation Project: RAG System Evaluation

## Introduction

This project is part of my graduation thesis, focused on evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a custom-built dataset. The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the RAG model in generating relevant and accurate responses based on the provided dataset. This project serves as a significant step in demonstrating the practical applications and potential improvements in the field of natural language processing.
